# encryption
A color image encryption algorithm based on compressive sensing and block based DNA coding

This project presents a novel method for color image encryption by integrating Compressive Sensing(cs) with DNA-based block coding.It compresses the image to reduce storage needs and then encrypts it using DNA sequences and chaotic algorithms.The result is secure,compact image that resists multiple forms of cuberattacks.
